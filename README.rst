Media processing and management utilities
-----------------------------------------

This is a collection of tools and utilities for processing media files and
managing media libraries.  It strives to follow the Unix philosophy of
DOTADIW, "Do One Thing And Do It Well."  The goal is to break the necessary
work down into tasks that are as discrete as possible so that they can be
composed variously to serve different environments and workloads.  Examples of
different ways to compose these tools may be provided but are not the only way
to do it.
